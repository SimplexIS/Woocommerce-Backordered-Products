Woocommerce-Backordered-Products
================================

This Wordpress plugin will create a submenu page, showing a table of all backordered products in Woocommerce.

Setup
-----

For now, you can install this plugin by placing the php file in wp-content/plugins. I'll try to connect GitHub and the Wordpress repository later.
